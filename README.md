This repository was built as part of the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>. One of the steps in the challenge involves creating a static resume website. This repo contains all the files needed to build a static resume website.

Three different resume versions are provided for you to use as a guide in creating your own resume website.

The primary version of the resume is based on the Dimension template at https://html5up.net/dimension. It is built using html, css, and javascript.

Note that although my resume is found on this repo, my projects are found at https://techwayfarer.com.

The other two resume versions are simple one-page designs. They can be found in the alternatives directory. The directory alternatives>onepagev1 contains my simpler one-page website. The directory alternatives>onepagev2 contains another one-page website design you might prefer.

If you are up for it, I suggest using a template from https://html5up.net/ for your own website design. They are more attractive than the simpler one-page designs and will give you more credibility with potential recruiters.
