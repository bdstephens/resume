# Resume Website Design

This repository was built as part of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev). One of the steps in the challenge involves creating a static resume website. This repo contains all the files needed to build a static resume website. The live version of the website can be found at https://bdstephens.github.io/resume/.

Four different resume versions are provided for you to use as a guide in creating your own resume website.

The files for the primary version of the resume is found in the parent directory of this repo. It is based on the Dimension template at https://html5up.net/dimension and is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The other three resume versions are simpler one-page designs and can be accessed in the alternatives directory. 
* The directory alternatives>onepagev1 contains my basic one-page website built with HTML, CSS and no Javascript.
* The directory alternatives>onepagev2 contains another basic one-page website design you might prefer. It is built with only HTML and CSS.
* The directory alternatives>onepagev3 contains another one-page design built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

If you are building a resume website, I suggest you choose one of the templates from [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net). They are more attractive than the simpler one-page designs and will give you more credibility with potential recruiters.

Note that although my resume is found on this repo, my projects are found at https://techwayfarer.com.
